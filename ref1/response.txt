Response to Reviewer's Comments:

First, we thank the referee for their report; we also apologize for the delay in
response.  We will address the comments of the referee in-line below.  In
addition to the changes discussed below we have modified the acknowledgements
section to add several new acknowledgements.

We have not changed the title.

We have done this; we now mention SONG in the abstract.  We have left TLS out of
the abstract since the archival data we use come only partially from TLS.

We have added two sentences with one reference addressing this point, in the
paragraph following Eq. (3).

Done.

Originally a separate set of models were used; now the same MESA models are used
for both the PARAM code and the insolation calculation.  This is explicitly
mentioned in the text (paragraph beginning "With the determination of the
stellar mass...").

We now state the medalist scale explicitly, with reference to Grevesse & Noels
(1993), from which it is derived and Rodrigues, et al. (2017) which describes
its use.  (First bullet point of C.1.)

We have added a sentence in Section 4.4 pointing to Abia+2012 and noting that
our non-asteroseismic mass value and uncertainty are consistent with that work.
The asteroseismic mass estimate is, of course, improved in uncertainty but
remains consistent.

The referee is correct that there is a large scatter in the reported metallicity
results for Aldebaran. The focus of this work is the new analysis of historical
RV data and how this allows new inference. The treatment this scatter of, or at
least justification of the selected metallicity, is beyond the scope of this
work. In the text we already indicate that there is a large scatter and hence we
select a number of metallicity values. While we agree there is little science
behind this selection it is still broadly representative and should allow
readers to interpret the impact of metallicity.

Data Editor's comments:

The authors should provide the RV data shown in Figure 3 as Data behind the
Figure (DbF). The readers would surely appreciate having this important data set
available with the published article.
